# AI Models and Data
# The plan specifies AI models are "pre-bundled in app assets" (Android) and "Resources" (iOS).
# Therefore, these asset/resource folders themselves are NOT ignored by this gitignore,
# assuming they contain the checked-in source models.
# If any large local development models are generated OR stored OUTSIDE of these
# bundled locations, add them here. E.g.:
# local_models/
# *.tflite
# *.mlmodel

# Workspace runtime database files (e.g., SQLite, CoreData .storefile) are typically
# generated off-repo in app-specific data directories. If any of these are
# accidentally committed for debugging, ignore common database file extensions:
# *.sqlite
# *.sqlite3
# *.storedata
# *.coredata
